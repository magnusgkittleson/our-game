My dearest Dacia, you are such an important part of my world. The story that we are writing together is one that I never want to forget. That is why I want to capture it here in a digital place we can interact with. I know it may seem small now, but one day this will be a whole world where we can explore our happiest memories, play games together, and send each other messages. It will exist long after we are gone. It will serve as a memory of what we built together. All my love, Magnus <3
